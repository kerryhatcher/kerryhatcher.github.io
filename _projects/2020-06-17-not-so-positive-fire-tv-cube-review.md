title: "My not so positive Fire TV Cube review"
date: 2020-05-19 12:00:00
description: My wife and I had just welcomed our 3rd child and all the stress (and joy) that come with that. We also have a history of always loosing the remotes to our TVs and smart devices. Our new TV had built in "smart" apps, but it was glitchy and sluggish. The commercials for the new(ish) Fire TV Cube showed how easy it was to control via voice commands. One video even showing a family using it while holding a newborn because the remote was out of reach. That hit home.

## The Good

It generally works well if you use the physical remote. The smartphone app remote is also fairly reliable (it's what we use the most) with some occasional issues connecting.

Content wise there wasn't anything we felt like we were missing. The only thing I can think of that wasn't available is the new Apple+ TV service. Of course Apple isn't going to put their app on other platforms, but there isn't anything there that made us miss it. We have a free year of Apple+ on our new iPhones and I've yet to find anything there I'm excited about.

The interface is really nice, especially the unified search. You can just look for a show and it will find it on all the available apps. It does tend to gently nudge you towards Amazon Prime video, but it didn't really bother me any. I use Prime video a lot, even before we got the Fire TV.

## The Bad

Voice control was by far the biggest let down. The only really reliable command we can use is to turn the TV on or off. Which is handy since the smartphone based remote control app lacks this feature. The stock remote is super easy to loose and doesn't have a built in tracker like the Roku does.

Basic navigation used to work for us (scroll down, select, etc) but that just stopped a couple of months ago for no reason. Now Alexa just tells us she can't do that. Voice control integration is the best with some 3rd party apps. For example YouTube vs YouTube TV. Half the time asking Alexa to open CBS on YouTube TV will result in opening regular YouTube. Most times asking to open a show will result in a screen asking you to pick which one you mean and with the basic navigation broken we have to use the remote to select the one we want.
